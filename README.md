# ft_ssl_md5

My realization of ```MD5```, a widely used message-digest algorithm (in other words, a hash function).

---

## Algorithms

Besides ```MD5``` itself, next ```SHA2``` family hash functions are implemented:

- `SHA256`
- `SHA224`
- `SHA512`
- `SHA384`

(Sorry, guys, no ```Whirlpool```:disappointed:)

---

## Features

```md5``` Linux terminal command is almost fully repeated (with flags -[pqrs]),  
with MD5 as well as SHA hash functions compliant to ```md5``` standard parsing behaviour

Futhermore, ```openssl``` standard input is implemented
