# ft_ssl_md5
My realization of ```MD5```, a widely used message-digest algorithm (in other words, a hash function).

---

### Besides ```MD5``` itself, next ```SHA2``` family hash functions are implemented:
   *SHA256  
   *SHA224  
   *SHA512  
   *SHA384  

---

###Additionally, ```md5``` Linux terminal command is almost fully repeated (with flags -[pqrs]), with MD5 as well as SHA hash functions compliant to ```md5``` standard parsing behaviour

---

### Futhermore, ```openssl``` standard input feature is implemented
